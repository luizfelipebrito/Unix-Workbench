### Reading

Three of my favorite books are: 

- *The Chronicles of Narnia* by C. S. Lewis 
- *Unbroken: A World War II Story of Survival, Resilience, and Redemption* by Laura Hillenbrand
- *Run with the Horses: The Quest for Life at Its Best* by Eugene H. Peterson

Last night I dreamt about eating in these restaurants:

2. Azura in Jerusalem. 
3. Gemma in New York City.
